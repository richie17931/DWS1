		<h1>Sushi</h1>
		<h5><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi">Original Article</a></h5>
		<p>Sushi is a Japanese food consisting of cooked vinegared rice combined with other
		   ingredients, usually raw fish or other seafood. Ingredients and forms of sushi 
		   presentation vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is
		   vinegared rice (also referred to as shari or sumeshi). Raw fish (or occasionally
		   meat) sliced and served without rice is called sashimi.</p>

		<h2><a id="history">History</a></h2>
		<p>The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi was first made in Southeast
		   Asia, possibly along what is now known as the Mekong River. The term sushi comes 
		   from an archaic grammatical form no longer used in other contexts; literally, 
		   sushi means "sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic fermented roots. The
		   oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, still very closely resembles this process, 
		   wherein fish is fermented via being wrapped in soured fermenting rice. The fish 
		   proteins break down via fermentation into their constituent amino acids. The 
		   fermenting rice and fish results in a sour taste and also one of the five basic
		   tastes, called umami in Japanese. Contemporary Japanese sushi has little 
		   resemblance to the traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Originally, when the 
		   fermented fish was taken out of the rice, only the fish was consumed while the 
		   fermented rice was discarded. The strong-tasting and smelling funazushi, a 
		   kind of narezushi made near Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional fermented
		   dish. Beginning in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) of Japan, vinegar was added 
		   to the mixture for better taste and preservation. The vinegar accentuated the 
		   rice's sourness and was known to increase its shelf life, allowing the fermentation 
		   process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. In the following centuries, sushi 
		   in Osaka evolved into oshi-zushi. The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden 
		   (usually bamboo) molds. By the mid 18th century, this form of sushi had reached Edo
		   (contemporary Tokyo). The contemporary version, internationally known as "sushi",
		   was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi
		   invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented (therefore
		   prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with one's hands. Originally, 
		   this sushi was known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in the 
		   Edo-mae (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay). Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer 
		   usually comes from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as Edomae nigirizushi.
           The Oxford English Dictionary notes the earliest written mention of sushi in 
           English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll 
           of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring". However, there is 
           also mention of sushi in a Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 
           article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.</p>
		<h2><a id="ingred">Ingredients</a></h2>
		<p>All sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients.</p>
		<h3><a id="sushimeshi">Sushi-meshi</a></h3>
		<p>Sushi-meshi is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a 
		   dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. 
		   It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a sushi 
		   or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is 
		   done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a 
		   wooden paddle (shamoji). Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, 
		   which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from 
		   India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness 
		   or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from 
		   glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much 
		   water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some 
		   fusion cuisine restaurants, short grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.
		   There are regional variations in sushi rice and, of course, individual chefs have 
		   their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: 
		   the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; 
		   in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.</p>
	   <h3><a id="nori">Nori</a></h3>
	   <p>The black seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori. Nori is a type of algae, 
	      traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from 
	      dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process 
	      similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, 
	      toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets. The size of a nori sheet influences the size 
	      of makimono. A full-size sheet produces futomaki, and a half produces hosomaki and 
	      temaki. To produce gunkan and some other makimono, an appropriately-sized piece of 
	      nori is cut from a whole sheet. Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available 
	      with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to 
	      be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi. When making fukusazushi, a 
	      paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelette is 
	      traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan (makiyakinabe), and used to form 
	      the pouch for the rice and fillings.</p>
	   <h3><a id="neta">Neta</a></h3>
	   <p>For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness 
	   	  of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. 
	   	  Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, 
	   	  firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. 
	   	  Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail
	   	  (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued 
	   	  sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of 
	   	  ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning "middle toro", 
	   	  implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. 
	   	  Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) 
	   	  and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will be completely raw. Other seafoods such 
	   	  as squid (ika), eel (anago and unagi), pike conger (hamo), octopus (tako), shrimp 
	   	  (ebi and amaebi), clam (mirugai, aoyagi and akagai), fish roe (ikura, masago, 
	   	  kazunoko and tobiko), sea urchin (uni), crab (kani), and various kinds of shellfish 
	   	  (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, 
	   	  are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. Kani kama, 
	   	  or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in 
	   	  California rolls. Pickled daikon radish (takuan) in shinko maki, pickled vegetables 
	   	  (tsukemono), fermented soybeans (nattō) in nattō maki, avocado, cucumber in kappa maki, 
	   	  asparagus, yam, pickled ume (umeboshi), gourd (kanpyō), burdock (gobo), and sweet 
	   	  corn (possibly mixed with mayonnaise) are also used in sushi. Tofu and eggs (in 
	   	  the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called tamagoyaki and raw quail eggs 
	   	  ride as a gunkan-maki topping) are common.</p>
	   <h3><a id="condiments">Condiments</a></h3>
	   <p>Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu, soy sauce, 
	      and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated root of the 
	      Wasabia japonica plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on 
	      salmon, pork and other sushi cuts. True wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may 
	      reduce the risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a 
	      sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from 
	      horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end 
	      kaiten-zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. 
	      If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled "Japanese Horseradish". Gari (sweet, 
	      pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid 
	   	  in digestion. In Japan, green tea (ocha) is invariably served together with sushi. 
	   	  Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as mecha. In sushi 
	   	  vocabulary, green tea is known as agari. Sushi may be garnished with gobo, grated 
	   	  daikon radish, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been 
	   	  shaped to look like flowers, real flowers and/or seaweed salad. When closely arranged 
	   	  on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa. 
	   	  Originally, these were cut leaves from, the Aspidistra elatior (haran) and Sasa veitchii 
	   	 (kuma-zasa) plants, respectively, but today, the strips are usually made from green plastic.</p>
