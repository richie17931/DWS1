			<h1>Winter Park, Florida</h1>
			<p>Winter Park is a suburban city in Orange County, Florida. The population was 
			27,852 at the 2010 United States Census.[3] It is part of the Orlando−Kissimmee 
			Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is home to Rollins College, Full Sail 
			University and the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art, which houses the 
			largest collection of Tiffany glass. Winter Park features open park space, 
			residential areas, and a street-side shopping district along Park Avenue. Winter 
			Park was founded as a resort community mainly by northern business magnates in the
			late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its main street includes civic buildings, 
			retail, art galleries, a private liberal arts college, museums, a park, a train 
			station, a golf course country club, a historic cemetery, and a beach and boat

 			<h2 id="history"><a id="history">History</a></h2>
 			<p>The Winter Park area's first human residents were migrant Muscogee people
 			who had earlier intermingled with the Choctaw and other indigenous people. In 
 			a process of ethnogenesis, the Native Americans formed a new culture which they 
 			called "Seminole", a derivative of the Mvskoke' (a Creek language) word 
 			simano-li, an adaptation of the Spanish cimarrón which means "wild" (in their 
 			case, "wild men"), or "runaway" [men].[4] The site was first inhabited by 
 			Europeans in 1858, when David Mizell Jr. bought an 8-acre (32,000 m2) homestead 
 			between Lakes Virginia, Mizell, and Berry. A settlement, called Lake View by 
 			the inhabitants, grew up around Mizell's plot. It got a post office and a new 
 			name—Osceola—in 1870. The area did not develop rapidly until 1880, when a South 
 			Florida Railroad track connecting Orlando and Sanford was laid a few miles west 
 			of Osceola. Shortly afterwards, Loring Chase came to Orange County from Chicago 
 			to recuperate from a lung disease. In his travels, he discovered the pretty group 
 			of lakes just east of the railbed. He enlisted a wealthy New Englander, Oliver 
 			E. Chapman, and they assembled a very large tract of land, upon which they 
 			planned the town of Winter Park. Over the next four years they plotted the town, 
 			opened streets, built a town hall and a store, planted orange trees, and 
 			required all buildings to meet stylistic and architectural standards. They 
 			promoted it heavily.[5] During this time, the railroad constructed a depot 
 			(1882), connected to Osceola by a dirt road. In 1885, a group of businessmen 
 			started the Winter Park Company and incorporated it with the Florida Legislature; 
 			Chase and Chapman sold the town to the new company. In a land bubble 
 			characteristic of Florida history, land prices soared from less than $2 per acre 
 			to over $200, with at least one sale recorded at $300 per acre. In 1885, the 
 			Congregational Assembly of Florida started Rollins College, the state's first 
 			four-year college. The following year the Seminole Hotel on Lake Osceola opened. 
 			This was a resort complete with the luxuries of the day: gas lights, steam 
 			heating, a string orchestra, a formal dining room, a bowling alley, and long 
 			covered porches.</p>

 			<h2><a id="geography">Geography</a></h2>
 			<p>The city is northeast of and adjacent to Orlando. Elevation ranges between 
 			66 and 97 feet (20 and 30 m) above sea level. According to the United States 
 			Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.2 square miles (26.3 km2). 8.7 
 			square miles (22.5 km2) of it is land and 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2) of it 
 			(14.62%) is water.[21] It is nestled among the Winter Park Chain of Lakes, a 
 			series of aquifer-fed lakes interconnected by a series of navigable canals, 
 			which were originally created for flood control and to run logs to a sawmill 
 			on present-day Lake Virginia. The lakes are popular for boating, watersports, 
 			fishing and swimming. The city is traversed by the old Orlando-Oviedo 
 			("Dinky Line") railroad bed, which until the 1960s had a stop at Lake 
 			Virginia/Rollins College at the city park now known as Dinky Dock. Much of this 
 			right of way has been converted to a rail-trail pedestrian/biking path in the 
 			form of the Cady Way Trail, which leads from Cady Way Park toward the Baldwin 
 			Park neighborhood and downtown Orlando, and in the opposite direction to Oviedo 
 			and beyond (via the Florida Trail), thanks to a new pedestrian bridge spanning 
 			Semoran Boulevard (SR 436) in Orange County. Currently, CSX Transportation 
 			operates a rail line through Winter Park on the former Atlantic Coast Line, 
 			with an Amtrak station in downtown's historic Central Park. Due to its close 
 			proximity to Orlando, Winter Park is a city which many commuters traverse to 
 			access downtown Orlando. These commuters come from outlying suburban areas such 
 			as Oviedo, Winter Springs, Maitland, Altamonte Springs and Casselberry. Winter 
 			Park's municipal government has combated speeding and aggressive driving in 
 			its downtown core and residential areas by lowering speed limits to 20 miles 
 			per hour (32 km/h) in some areas, adding textured traffic-calming brick roads, 
 			and aggressively enforcing the law within the city limits. These measures have 
 			contributed to some traffic congestion, but preserve the quality of life for 
 			residents and encourage pass-thru commuters to seek alternate, more appropriate 
 			high-speed routes to downtown (such as SR436/Semoran Blvd, Lake Howell Road, 
 			US17-92/Orlando Ave, Interstate 4, and the 408/East West Expressway and 
 			417/Greeneway toll roads).</p>
